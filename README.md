# Email Sending Service

This Node.js service sends emails using the `nodemailer` package. The email configurations (SMTP server, credentials, etc.) are loaded from environment variables defined in a `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the service, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd yourrepository
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:

```bash
# .env file

HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
Email_PORT=465
EMAIL=
PASS=
RECEIVER=
```

- `HOST`: The SMTP server to use for sending emails.
- `Email_PORT`: The port for the SMTP server (465 is used for secure connections).
- `EMAIL`: The sender's email address.
- `PASS`: The password for the sender's email account.
- `RECEIVER`: The default email receiver.

## Usage

The service provides an asynchronous function `sendEmail()` that can be used to send emails.

### Example

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from './path-to-service-file';

(async () => {
  try {
    await sendEmail(
      'recipient@example.com', // Recipient email
      'Test Subject',          // Subject of the email
      'This is the email body'  // Email message
    );
    console.log('Email sent successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send email:', error.message);
  }
})();
```

### Send Email Function

This service exports a function called `sendEmail` which takes the following parameters:

- `to`: Recipient's email address.
- `subject`: Subject of the email.
- `message`: Body of the email.

## Running the Service

Ensure the `.env` file is properly configured, then run the service:

```bash
node your-service-file.js
```

## Error Handling

If the service encounters an issue (such as an invalid SMTP configuration or missing environment variables), it will throw an error, and youâ€™ll see a detailed message in the console log.
